# AI-Education-Hypothesis  
### Core framework, documentation and prototype notes for an AI-driven simulated education system (Hypothesis v1).

---

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains the theoretical framework, structural methodology, and prototype notes of the **AI-Driven Simulated Education System Hypothesis**.  
The purpose of this work is to propose a **modern, adaptable, AI-supported, simulation-enhanced educational architecture** for the 21st century.

The repository includes:

- **AI-Driven Simulated Education – Core Framework (EN)**  
- **AI Temelli Simüle Eğitim Sistemi – Çekirdek Framework (TR)**  
- Versioning notes  
- Licensing information  

All files are structured for academic transparency and future collaboration.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Hypothesis

The hypothesis presents a **system-level re-evaluation of modern education**, suggesting that:

- current education systems cannot update themselves at the required pace,  
- societal issues (economics, ethics, justice, social cohesion) often stem from this outdated structure,  
- and AI-supported, simulation-based, continuously-patched educational architecture can act as a solution.

Both versions (TR & EN) contain:

- Systemic problem definition  
- Purpose  
- Digital Twin model  
- AI Meta-Layers (AMTL, Balancing Layer, Guardian Layer)  
- Accessibility & anonymity principles  
- Learning Evolution Committee (LEC)  
- Competition model  
- Versioning structure
